abstract: Mature citrus leaves are highly responsive to pathogens but difficult to transform genetically. Here, we report an optimized Agrobacterium-mediated transient transformation method for mature Mexican lime (Citrus aurantifolia) leaves. Combining microwounding with dithiothreitol and Silwet enhanced RUBY reporter expression up to fivefold. qRT-PCR confirmed increased transient gene overexpression. This is the first demonstration of efficient in situ transient expression in mature citrus leaves, facilitating functional genomics in this species.
