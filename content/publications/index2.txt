abstract: This study optimized ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis in malting and forage barley to identify drought-tolerant mutants. The optimal treatment was 0.5% EMS for 2.6–2.7 hours, balancing survival and growth. Ten forage mutants survived drought stress, and three (For-7, For-8, For-10) showed reduced leaf water loss. These results provide valuable genetic resources for breeding drought-resilient barley varieties.
