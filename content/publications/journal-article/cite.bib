   abstract = {Geminiviruses are important plant pathogens that affect crops around the world. In some geminivirus–host interactions, infected plants show recovery, a phenomenon characterized by symptom disappearance in newly emerging leaves. In pepper–Pepper golden mosaic virus (PepGMV) interaction, the host recovery process involves a silencing mechanism that includes both post-transcriptional (PTGS) and transcriptional (TGS) gene silencing pathways. Under field conditions, PepGMV is frequently found in mixed infections with Pepper huasteco yellow vein virus (PHYVV), another bipartite begomovirus. Mixed infected plants generally show a synergetic phenomenon and do not present recovery. Little is known about the molecular mechanism of this interaction. In the present study, we explored the effect of superinfection by PHYVV on a PepGMV-infected pepper plant showing recovery. Superinfection with PHYVV led to (a) the appearance of severe symptoms, (b) an increase of the levels of PepGMV DNA accumulation, (c) a decrease of the relative methylation levels of PepGMV DNA, and (d) an increase of chromatin activation marks present in viral minichromosomes. Finally, using heterologous expression and silencing suppression reporter systems, we found that PHYVV REn presents TGS silencing suppressor activity, whereas similar experiments suggest that Rep might be involved in suppressing PTGS.},
